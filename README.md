Hearthboard is a self-hosted dashboard for tracking homelab services, devices, and links. It includes a React frontend, a Fastify API, SQLite persistence, CRUD service management, health checks, drag-and-drop ordering, and CSV import/export.

The app starts with an empty database. Add services manually or import them from CSV.

## Features

- Add, edit, delete, reorder, and group services
- HTTP, Ping, TCP, and disabled health-check modes
- Service status cards with last-check time and response time
- Search, category filters, status filters, grid view, and list view
- Manage mode for bulk delete, drag ordering, CSV import, CSV export, and template download
- Dashboard header customization
- Docker Compose deployment with persistent SQLite storage
- Kubernetes manifests with Kustomize overlays
- Local stdio MCP server for AI clients with full service/settings CRUD
- Nginx reverse proxy friendly

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The database is stored in the Docker volume `hearthboard-data`.

### Using a published image

After the GHCR image is available, set `HEARTHBOARD_IMAGE=ghcr.io/j4v3l/hearthboard:latest` in `.env`, then:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## First Run

The public version ships with no services. To populate it:

1. Open the dashboard.
2. Click `Manage`.
3. Click `Add Service` to add one item manually, or click `Template` to download a CSV template.
4. Fill out the CSV and use `Import CSV`.

## Service Fields

Each service has:

- `name`: Display name. Required.
- `description`: Short description.
- `category`: One of `AI`, `Infrastructure`, `Media`, `Network`, or `Security`.
- `url`: Optional URL opened by the `Open` button.
- `healthUrl`: Target used by the health check. This may be different from `url`.
- `checkType`: One of `HTTP`, `Ping`, `TCP`, or `None`.
- `icon`: Icon name used in the UI.
- `statusCheckEnabled`: `true` or `false`.

## Health Checks

### HTTP

Use this for websites, web apps, and HTTP APIs.

Examples:

```text
https://app.example.test
https://app.example.test/health
```

HTTP checks require a full `http://` or `https://` URL.

### Ping

Use this for devices where you only need to know whether the host responds to ICMP.

Examples:

```text
router.lan
192.0.2.10
```

Docker requires `cap_add: NET_RAW` for ICMP ping checks. HTTP and TCP checks do not need it.

Enable Ping support with the optional ICMP overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.icmp.yml up -d --build
```

### TCP

Use this for checking whether a host and port are reachable.

Examples:

```text
server.lan:22
database.lan:5432
```

### None

Use this for bookmarks or services you do not want monitored.

## CSV Import And Export

Manage mode includes:

- `Template`: Downloads `hearthboard-import-template.csv`.
- `Import CSV`: Imports services.
- `Export CSV`: Exports the current dashboard as `hearthboard-services.csv`.

Required CSV headers:

```csv
name,description,category,url,healthUrl,checkType,icon,statusCheckEnabled
```

Import modes:

- `Add as new services`: Creates every row as a new service. Warnings are shown if names already exist.
- `Update matching names`: Updates existing services when exactly one matching name exists. Blocks if a name is ambiguous.
- `Skip existing names`: Adds only rows whose names do not already exist.

Warnings do not block import. Issues do block import.

## Configuration

Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP port inside the container |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `/data/hearthboard.db` in Docker | SQLite database path |
| `HEALTH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Per-check timeout |
| `SLOW_THRESHOLD_MS` | `1500` | Response time considered slow |
| `ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS` | `false` in Compose/Kubernetes | Allows self-signed/internal HTTPS certificates |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | `120` | API rate limit per window |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` | `1 minute` | API rate limit window |

## Nginx Reverse Proxy

This app is designed to run at the root of a hostname, for example:

```text
https://dashboard.example.test/
```

Example Nginx location:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend/API together through the Fastify server after building:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Run the Docker image from your local source while developing:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Run the Vite dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the API directly:

```bash
npm run dev:api
```

## Kubernetes

Apply the default overlay:

```bash
kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes/overlays/default
kubectl -n hearthboard port-forward svc/hearthboard 3000:80
```

For ICMP Ping checks:

```bash
kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes/overlays/icmp
```

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for storage classes, ingress, probes, backups, and upgrades.

## MCP (AI clients)

HearthBoard includes a local stdio MCP server that proxies the running REST API. Start the app first, then run:

```bash
npm run mcp
```

Set `HEARTHBOARD_BASE_URL` if the API is not on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md) for client configuration, tool catalog, confirmation gates, and troubleshooting.

## Data Backup

For normal use, the easiest backup is `Manage -> Export CSV`.

The SQLite database also lives in the Docker volume:

```text
hearthboard-data
```

## Security Notes

This project currently does not include authentication. Run it on a trusted LAN or place it behind your own authentication layer if exposing it remotely.

The local stdio MCP server grants dashboard-admin-equivalent access to services and settings for any client that can reach the running API. Destructive MCP tools require `confirm: true`, but read and write tools are otherwise unrestricted.

Health checks can make outbound requests to hosts entered in the dashboard. Treat users with dashboard access as trusted.

ICMP ping requires `NET_RAW` in Docker or Kubernetes. Remove the ICMP overlay if you do not need Ping checks.

`ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=true` is convenient for internal/self-signed services. The default in Compose and Kubernetes is `false`.
